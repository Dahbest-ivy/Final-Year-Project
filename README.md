# Final-Year-Project
My final year project

The project was co-designed by Oloro Oluwatoba Stephen and my friend Michael Idebi

To use this system, several dependencies must be installed on the user's system

Like pip, virtual environment, and the rest of them because it's a python system with
Django database.


After installing the right dependencies, run the manage.py file in your code editor 
to see the system

Thank You For trying out my program. There's room for improvement.

Do well to reach out to me for further development
